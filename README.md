# ✨ Tigger ✨

*Tigger is a clone of git that is built in Posix Shell. *

Tigger works very similar as git. The command `tigger-init`, just like `git init` creates a new repository under the current directory. 

---

Current working features includes:

- `tigger-init`
- `tigger-add`
- `tigger-commit [-a] -m 'commit message'`
- `tigger-rm [-force] [-cached] <filenames>`
- `tigger-status`
- `tigger-log`

---

Some future feature to look forward to: 
- `tigger-branch`
- `tigger-merge`
- `tigger-checkout`
